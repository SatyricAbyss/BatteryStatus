# Battery Status Emoji
This small hackathon application is a proof-of-concept set up during a BlueBird Day (a Handpicked Agency) Hackathon, which took only 2 hours to set up entirely. The concept it means to prove is that, through certain JS code, you can read out certain device stats which can help you decide whether to load in certain scripts or not, like say if your website is very resource heavy for an older phone, you can choose to not load certain scripts which wouldn't impact the code too much.

# How to run it?
Well... I've made this simple to run for ya. If you want to check it's function out, you can go to https://www.meltingcorestudios.com/pages/demos/simulated-battery/ where you can use a slider to simulate a battery draining. The slider functions as the battery.

If you want to check it out using your real battery stats, which can only be read if you have disabled your AdBlock software, you can check out https://www.meltingcorestudios.com/pages/demos/battery-emoji/ which using the browser API can read your battery status. For more demos, when uploaded, check the website!
